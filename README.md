**FuncPilot** is a project brought to life by the recently published Version 4 of
the [Node Programming Model in Azure Functions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-functions-version-4-of-the-node-js-programming-model-is-in/ba-p/3773541)
(currently in public preview). Thanks to the improvements in the new programming model, this project aims to provide a
solid structure for your Node function apps written in TypeScript while offering frequently used services and components
with a first-class developer experience, inspired and known from great frameworks
like [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com) and similar.
